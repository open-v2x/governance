# OpenV2X Governance

The repository contains OpenV2X Technical Steering Committee reference documents and tracks official
resolutions voted by the committee. It also contains a library for accessing some of the
machine-readable data in the repository.

Directory structure:

- reference/

  Reference documents which need to be revised over time. Some motions will just directly result in
  reference doc changes.

- resolutions/

  When the motion does not result in a change in a reference doc, it can be expressed as a
  resolution. Those must be named YYYYMMDD-short-name with YYYYMMDD being the proposal date in order
  to allow basic sorting.

- goals/

  Documentation for OpenV2X community-wide goals, organized by release cycle. These pages will be
  updated with project status info over time, and if goals are revised.
