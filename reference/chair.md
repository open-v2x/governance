# TSC Chair Responsibilities

> Note: This document is maintained as a simple text file, outside of the published governance document, because it is meant to be used for shared notes rather than as an official "guide to being TSC chair".

- Keep the TSC informed of important Board actions
  - attend board meetings when possible
  - follow board discussions on the mailing list(s)
